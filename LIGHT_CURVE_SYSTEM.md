# 🌊 Light Curve Analysis System

## ✅ **What We Have Now**

### **Light Curve Dataset**
- **203 transit light curves** (.tbl format)
- **13 confirmed exoplanet systems**:
  - WASP18, HD17156, HD189733, HD209458
  - GJ436, HATP2, HATP11, XO1
  - TRES1, TRES2, HD149026, HD68988, HD80606

### **Data Structure**
Each light curve contains:
- **Time-series data**: HJD, phase, flux measurements
- **Transit information**: Depth, duration, shape
- **Uncertainties**: Error bars on all measurements
- **Model fits**: Best-fit transit models
- **Observational data**: Airmass, systematics

### **Feature Extraction** ✅
Successfully extracting **28 features** per light curve:

#### Transit Features (13):
- Mean/std/min/max flux
- Transit depth (absolute & ppm)
- Transit duration in phase
- Orbital period
- Number of datapoints

#### Statistical Features (9):
- Skewness, kurtosis
- Percentiles (5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 95th)
- Autocorrelation
- Mean/median uncertainty

#### Frequency Features (6):
- Dominant frequency & power
- Total power spectrum
- Low-frequency power

## 🚀 **Next Steps - Three Enhancement Paths**

### **Path 1: Deep Learning on Light Curves** 🧠

Build CNN/LSTM models that directly analyze light curve shapes:

```python
# 1D CNN for Light Curves
Input: Time-series flux array [batch, timesteps, 1]
   ↓
Conv1D layers (extract patterns)
   ↓
MaxPooling (reduce dimensions)
   ↓
LSTM layers (capture temporal dependencies)
   ↓
Dense layers
   ↓
Output: Exoplanet probability
```

**Files to create:**
```
backend/models/cnn_light_curve_model.py
backend/models/lstm_light_curve_model.py
backend/utils/light_curve_preprocessor.py
```

**What it will do:**
- Learn transit patterns directly from flux data
- Handle variable-length sequences
- Detect subtle transits humans might miss
- Predict multiple planet parameters simultaneously

---

### **Path 2: Fine-Tuning & Transfer Learning** 🎯

Enhance existing models with new data and techniques:

```python
Fine-Tuning System:
1. Load pre-trained model (XGBoost 98.95%)
2. Freeze base layers
3. Add new data (light curves features)
4. Incremental learning
5. Hyperparameter optimization
6. A/B testing

Transfer Learning:
- Use light curve CNN as feature extractor
- Combine with tabular data
- Multi-modal learning
```

**Files to create:**
```
backend/models/fine_tuner.py
backend/models/incremental_learner.py
backend/models/hyperparameter_optimizer.py
backend/models/ensemble_combiner.py
```

**What it will do:**
- Update models without full retraining
- Combine light curve + catalog features
- Optimize hyperparameters automatically
- Build ensemble of all models

### **Path 3: AI Chatbot with RAG** 🤖💬

Intelligent assistant that explains predictions and answers questions:

```python
RAG Architecture:
1. Vector Database (ChromaDB/FAISS)
   - Index: Training results, metrics, papers
   - Embeddings: sentence-transformers

2. Ollama LLM Integration
   - Local models: llama3, mistral, codellama
   - Context-aware responses
   - Exoplanet knowledge

3. Query Pipeline
   User Question → Retrieve Context → LLM → Answer
```

**Files to create:**
```
backend/llm/ollama_client.py
backend/llm/rag_system.py
backend/llm/vector_store.py
backend/llm/document_indexer.py
backend/api/chat_endpoints.py
frontend/src/pages/ChatAssistant.jsx
```

**Example Conversations:**
```
User: "Why was this classified as false positive?"
Bot: "Analyzing TOI-1234's light curve shows:
     - Transit depth variation > 20%
     - Stellar contamination flag active
     - Period instability detected
     This suggests stellar activity rather than
     a planetary transit."

User: "Compare WASP18 to similar hot Jupiters"
Bot: *Retrieves from vector DB*
     "WASP18b characteristics:
     - Transit depth: 32,070 ppm
     - Period: 0.94 days
     Similar systems:
     1. WASP-12b: 28,400 ppm, 1.09 days
     2. KELT-9b: 24,100 ppm, 1.48 days"
```
